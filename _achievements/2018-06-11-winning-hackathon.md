&nbsp;&nbsp; This visualization represents 300'000 Georgians who were enlisted in World War Two. Unfortunately, their families lost them in the the war and their descendants may even don't know anything about them.


&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Georgians are only one mouse click away to find their lost ancestors with all other information about them.


It includes:
* WebGL and d3.js animation from place of recruitment to place of death. Each point represents one person. So we have up to 300'000 points! Pretty fast using WebGL!
* possibility to search people and find ancestors.
* get statistical information for each region and city.
