## Details

I created some visual visual tools for [stone ridge technology](https://stoneridgetechnology.com/)
<br/><br/><br/>

# 1.  spline editor

# 2. timeline

This visual was highly focused on performance. By leveraging [virtual scroll](http://bl.ocks.org/nithinankam/b397789718c4e2667d448d28c3d882d2), I was able to remove performance restriction, related to active html dom elements counts

Features:

* Zoomable
* Pannable
* Tooltip
* Virtual scroll
